This is a simple React Native project called **Roll-a-Dice**. The app demonstrates the basics of React Native by allowing users to roll a virtual dice and display the result.


## Understanding React Native

This project is designed to help myself understand the basics of React Native, including:

- **Components**: Learn how to create and use reusable components.
- **State Management**: Understand how to manage state using React's `useState` hook.
- **Styling**: Apply styles using React Native's `StyleSheet`.
- **Platform-Specific Development**: Run the app on both Android and iOS.
